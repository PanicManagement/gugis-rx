Gugis-Rx [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/gugis-rx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/gugis-rx) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.lukaszbudnik.gugis/gugis-rx/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.lukaszbudnik.gugis/gugis-rx)
==============================

Gugis-Rx is a lightweight and robust framework for creating composite components using Guice.

Gugis-Rx uses Guava and RxJava and works on Java 6+ (Travis runs tests against: openjdk6, openjdk7, oraclejdk7, and oraclejdk8).

The original [Gugis](https://github.com/lukaszbudnik/gugis) uses Java 8 parallel streams and is much faster.
However, as it requires Java 8, it may not be suitable for applications which still run on older Java versions.

# Gugis and Gugis-Rx difference

Gugis-Rx uses RxJava which does not offer parallel `Observable`. Because of this Gugis-Rx does
not offer `Propagation.FASTEST`. The original Gugis unit tests `BasicTest.shouldPropagateToFastest()` and
`ErrorHandlingTest.shouldSelectSlowerBecauseFasterThrowsException()` were commented out.
When/if RxJava will support parallel processing then support for `Propagation.FASTEST` will be also ported to Gugis-Rx.

# Gugis-Rx

Please refer to the original [Gugis](https://github.com/lukaszbudnik/gugis) documentation. With the exception of `Propagation.FASTEST`
both implementations are compatible.

# Examples

See `src/test/java` for lots of unit tests and examples.
