==============================

Guice and RxJava-based lightweight and robust framework for creating composite components.

The original [Gugis](https://github.com/lukaszbudnik/gugis) is written using Java 8 parallel streams and... works on Java 8 only.

Gugis-Rx uses RxJava `Observable` for parallel processing and Guava for fluent iterables. Gugis-Rx runs on Java 6+.

# Gugis-Rx

Please refer to the original [Gugis](https://github.com/lukaszbudnik/gugis) documentation.

# Gugis and Gugis-Rx difference

Original Gugis uses Java 8 parallel streams. Parallel streams turned out to be much faster than RxJava (testing on my MacBook Pro).

The difference can be best illustrated by using `Propagation.FASTEST`. The original Gugis unit test `BasicTest.shouldPropagateToFastest()`
was always passing for the Gugis Java 8 implementation. For Gugis-Rx the same unit test was sometimes failing. To make it
always pass I had to increase difference in sleep methods for `Thread.sleep()` for the sample services.

# Examples

See `src/test/java` for lots of unit tests and examples.

# Download

Use the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
